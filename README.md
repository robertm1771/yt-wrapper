# yt-wrapper
Simple three-panel URL wrapper for streaming or monitoring.

## How it works

- Paste any URL in the left input and enter one or two URLs for the right-hand panels, then click **Load/Refresh All**. Leave an input blank to clear that panel. The URLs are remembered locally so the same views come back the next time you open the page. Empty frames now show an on-screen reminder instead of leaving you staring at a blank panel.
- Drag the vertical or horizontal dividers to resize the side and bottom frames. Your preferred layout is saved locally and restored automatically.
- Press **Enter** inside any input to trigger loading or refreshing for all frames.

Status messages below the controls confirm when frames are loaded or cleared.
