# yt-wrapper
Simple three-panel URL wrapper for streaming or monitoring.

## How it works

- Paste any URL in the left input and click **Load Left Frame**. Leave the input blank to clear the panel. The URL is remembered locally so the same view comes back the next time you open the page. Empty frames now show an on-screen reminder instead of leaving you staring at a blank panel.
- Enter any two URLs for the right-hand frames and click **Load Right Frames** to display them. Leave inputs blank to clear the frames. The URLs you load are remembered locally so the same views come back the next time you open the page. Empty frames use the same friendly reminder.
- Drag the vertical or horizontal dividers to resize the side and bottom frames. Your preferred layout is saved locally and restored automatically.
- Press **Enter** inside any input to trigger the appropriate load action.
- Use **Refresh Left Frame** and **Refresh Right Frames** to reload the existing panels without changing their URLs.

Status messages below the controls confirm when frames are loaded or cleared.
